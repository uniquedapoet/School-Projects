Hello
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
But I missed my bed
So I soon came home

[Verse]
They said, ""There's too much caffeine in your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice in your life""
I said, ""Leave me alone because I'm alright, dad
Just surprised to still be on my own...""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again

[Chorus]
A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
It has been before, so it shall be again
And people who are uglier than you and I
They take what they need and just leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again

A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
It has been before, so why can't it be now?
And people who are weaker than you and I
They take what they want from life

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, but don't mention love
Nom, just don't mention love!

[Chorus]
A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
Your youth may be gone, but you're still a young man
So phone me, phone me, phone me
So phone me, phone me, phone me

The lanes were silent
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced three-word gesture

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something and now I'm not too sure

[Verse 2]
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Oh, that's what tradition means
And I doused another venture
With a gesture that was absolutely vile

I was delayed, I was waylaid

And plan a mass murder
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never!
Who said I'd lied because I never?

[Verse 2]
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen
And broke my knee

I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
You're just the same as I am
What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm
So, in my bedroom in those ""ugly new houses""
I danced my legs down to the knees
But me and my ""true love""
We will never meet again

At the record company meeting
On their hands, at last, a dead star

(I don't bless them)
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry, but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say, Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the eighteenth pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh, has the world changed or have I changed?
Oh, has the world changed or have I changed?

Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see lights
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Verse 2]
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought ""Oh God, my chance has come at last""
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one

For the ghost and the storm outside
Will not invade this sacred shrine
Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalize

Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said, ""Never, never, never again""

Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Verse 1: Morrissey]
Boy in a million, idol, a big star
I didn't tell you how great you were
I didn't grovel and scream and rip
Your brand new jacket at the seams
You made a record, they liked your singing
All of a sudden the phone stops ringing
Ah, I never thought that you would let
The glory make you forget

[Chorus: Kirsty MacColl]
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

Top ten idol, king of your age
Who do you turn to when you're backstage?
Don't you remember you once knew a girl
You loved her more than the world
Is life always like this, brother?
Good for one side but bad for another
I must put you behind me tonight
Cause you belong to the lights

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said, ""I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known""
And then you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

[Verse 2]
I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song to a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs that made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe on the bedroom floor
And said, ""Oh, oh, smother me mother""
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di la da da dey di

[Verse 2]
The passing of time and all of its crimes
Is making me sad again
The passing of time and all of its sickening crimes
Is making me sad again
But don't forget the songs that made you cry
And the songs that saved your life
Yes, you're older now and you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you

[Verse 3]
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
I'm here with the cause, I'm holding the torch
In the corner of your room (Can you hear me?)
And when you're dancing and laughing and finally living
Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly

On the high-rise estate
What's at the back of your mind?
On a three day debate, on a high-rise estate
But what's at the back of your mind?
Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay and general decay
Nature must still find a way
So, ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile impulses sway
This way and that way, and this way and that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

[Chorus]
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out and
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down

[Bridge]
As we lie, you say
""Will the world end in the night time?""
I really don't know
""Or will the world end in the day time?""
I really don't know
""And is there any point ever having children?""
Oh, I don't know
All I do know is we're here and it's now
