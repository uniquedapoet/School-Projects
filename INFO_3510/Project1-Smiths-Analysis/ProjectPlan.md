### Project Plan: Creating a Language Model to Generate Smiths-Style Lyrics

#### Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to answer the question: *Can I create a language model that generates lyrics in the style of The Smiths based on their previous songs?* By training a language model (LMM) on The Smiths' lyrics, I aim to explore whether a machine learning model can capture their distinct lyrical patterns and themes. I will use Python, the Hugging Face `transformers` library, and data preprocessing techniques to achieve this.

#### Data Collection:
- **Main Dataset**: I will collect lyrics from all The Smiths' albums and songs. These will be compiled into a CSV or text format for easier data manipulation. I'll use tools like the Genius API or scrape from websites such as AZLyrics.
- **Supplemental Data**: In addition to the lyrics, I may include album release dates or song metadata (e.g., genre or mood), which could enhance the fine-tuning of the language model.

#### Questions to Answer:
1. Can a fine-tuned language model (based on GPT-2) generate lyrics that mimic The Smiths' style?
2. What are the distinct lyrical patterns in The Smiths' songs that the model captures?
3. How do the generated lyrics compare to the actual lyrics in terms of linguistic structure, themes, or sentiment?

#### Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the lyrics data by removing unwanted characters, punctuation, and formatting.
   - Tokenize the lyrics using a tokenizer from the Hugging Face `transformers` library, which will allow the model to learn the structure and flow of the lyrics.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - I will use GPT-2, a transformer-based language model from Hugging Face, for the base model. This model will be fine-tuned specifically on The Smiths' lyrics.

3. **Training the Model**:
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model using the cleaned and tokenized Smiths lyrics.
   - I will adjust training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate) and track training progress over multiple iterations to improve the model’s performance.
   
4. **Generating Smiths-Style Lyrics**:
   - Once trained, I will generate new lyrics using the model by providing it with short seed phrases, such as "I am human and I need to be loved" to see how the model continues the sentence in The Smiths' style.
   
5. **Evaluation and Comparison**:
   - Evaluate the generated lyrics by comparing them to real Smiths lyrics using linguistic metrics like word frequency, thematic consistency, and sentiment analysis.
   - I will also manually evaluate the lyrical themes to see how well the generated content captures the distinct melancholy and romanticism of The Smiths.

#### Anticipated Challenges:
- **Limited Dataset**: The Smiths have a relatively small discography, so the model might overfit or struggle to generalize well. To overcome this, I may experiment with different data augmentation strategies or include lyrics from similar artists (Morrissey’s solo work, for instance) to expand the dataset.
- **Model Performance**: The quality of generated lyrics may vary depending on the hyperparameters used in training. I will conduct multiple experiments to fine-tune the model’s output and document the trade-offs between creativity and coherence.
- **Computational Resources**: Fine-tuning GPT-2 requires significant computational power. To handle this, I will train the model on Google Colab or use cloud-based resources with GPUs.

#### Visualizations:
- **Word Cloud**: I will create word clouds to visualize the most common words in the generated lyrics versus the original Smiths lyrics.
- **Word Frequency Plot**: A bar chart showing the frequency of certain thematic words (e.g., "love", "death", "hope") in both generated and original lyrics.
- **Model Training Plot**: A graph of the model’s loss over time to show how well the model learned from the data.
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Sentiment analysis or topic modeling of the generated vs. original lyrics to compare the emotional or thematic structure.

#### Writeup Outline:
1. **Introduction**: 
   - Briefly explain the purpose of the project and the question I seek to answer: Can I train a language model to generate lyrics in the style of The Smiths?
   
2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Describe the data sources (lyrics from The Smiths), preprocessing steps (cleaning, tokenization), and how the dataset was structured.

3. **Model Training and Approach**:
   - Explain the choice of GPT-2, why it’s appropriate for this task, and the fine-tuning process. Discuss the specific hyperparameters used and the tools (Hugging Face, Python) employed.
   
4. **Generated Lyrics**:
   - Provide examples of generated lyrics and compare them to real lyrics in terms of linguistic structure, themes, and sentiment.
   
5. **Results and Visualizations**:
   - Present visualizations (word clouds, frequency plots, training loss) and analyze the results.
   - Discuss any patterns the model captured and whether the generated lyrics align with The Smiths’ style.

6. **Challenges and Future Work**:
   - Reflect on challenges faced during model training (e.g., small dataset, computational limits).
   - Discuss potential improvements, such as incorporating melody or musical structure into the generation process, or expanding the dataset with similar artists.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize findings, including whether the model successfully captured The Smiths' lyrical style and what future steps could be taken to improve the project.

#### Tools and Resources:
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For model fine-tuning and generation.
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, nltk)**: For data preprocessing and visualization.
- **Google Colab or Cloud GPUs**: For training the model with access to necessary computational power.
- **Genius API or Web Scraping**: For collecting Smiths lyrics.

#### Next Steps:
1. Gather the lyrics dataset and preprocess it.
2. Set up the training environment (Google Colab, Hugging Face API).
3. Fine-tune the GPT-2 model using The Smiths' lyrics.
4. Evaluate the generated output and iterate to improve the model.
5. Complete visualizations and write the project report.
