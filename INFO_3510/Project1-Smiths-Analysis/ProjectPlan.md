Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve your project:

### Step 1: **Data Collection**
   - **Objective**: Gather a comprehensive collection of The Smiths' song lyrics.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Use the **Spotify API** to get the discography details of The Smiths (e.g., album names, song titles).
     2. Leverage the **Genius Lyric API** to fetch lyrics for each song using the song titles and artist information.

### Step 2: **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - **Objective**: Clean and prepare the lyrics data for analysis.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Remove special characters (e.g., punctuation, symbols) and convert text to lowercase to standardize the lyrics.
     2. Use **NLTK** to tokenize the lyrics into individual words. If NLTK doesn't provide the needed flexibility, apply **regex** for more customized text manipulation.
     3. Remove stop words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") to focus on meaningful words.

### Step 3: **Data Categorization and Theme Identification**
   - **Objective**: Identify main recurring themes in The Smiths’ lyrics.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Analyze word frequency to identify the most commonly used words after cleaning.
     2. Group these words into categories like "love," "conflict," or other relevant themes.
     3. Create a **DataFrame** containing songs, themes, and other characteristics for easy comparison.

### Step 4: **Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Determine the sentiment expressed in each song.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Use the **TextBlob** library to calculate sentiment scores for each song (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
     2. Review the results manually to check for discrepancies where the sentiment might not align with the song’s tone.
     3. Update the DataFrame with sentiment scores for further analysis.

### Step 5: **Visualization Setup**
   - **Objective**: Visualize the themes and sentiment changes over time.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Use **WordCloud** to create word maps based on word frequency, showing the most prominent words in The Smiths’ lyrics.
     2. Use **Altair** to create graphs tracking sentiment changes over the discography timeline, showing how emotional tones evolve over albums and time.

### Step 6: **Analyze and Interpret Results**
   - **Objective**: Deeply interpret the themes and sentiments to uncover insights.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Compare the visualizations and sentiment scores across different albums and timeframes.
     2. Identify any patterns in theme evolution or shifts in emotional tone over the years.
     3. Review any discrepancies in sentiment (e.g., upbeat music with dark lyrics) and manually interpret these cases.

### Step 7: **Final Review and Refinement**
   - **Objective**: Ensure accuracy and add context.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Listen to The Smiths’ music alongside the analysis to verify that the sentiment matches the tone.
     2. Refine visualizations and analysis based on findings and manual reviews.

### Step 8: **Documentation and Writeup**
   - **Objective**: Document your findings and compile the results into a comprehensive report.
   - **Action Items**:
     1. Write a detailed summary of the methods used, the insights discovered, and the overall evolution of The Smiths' themes and emotional patterns.
     2. Include visualizations and interpretations to support your analysis.
     3. Reflect on any limitations or areas where further analysis might be needed.

This plan will guide you through each phase of the project, ensuring that you cover all necessary steps from data collection to final analysis and visualization.
