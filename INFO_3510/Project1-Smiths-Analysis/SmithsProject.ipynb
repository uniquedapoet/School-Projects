    "3. **Data Categorization and Theme Identification**\n",

    "4. **Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Determine the sentiment expressed in each song.\n",
    "5. **Visualization Setup**\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Visualize the themes and sentiment changes over time.\n",
    "6. **Analyze and Interpret Results**\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Deeply interpret the themes and sentiments to uncover insights.\n",
    "7. **Final Review and Refinement**\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Ensure accuracy and add context.\n",
